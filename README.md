## Arduino IoT Cloud

### Introduction
The ArduinoIoTCloud library is the central element of the firmware enabling certain development boards to connect to the Arduino IoT Cloud. This platform allows anyone to create internet connected devices, and all in one solution for **configuration, writing code, uploading and visualization**.
With the Arduino IoT Cloud desktop or mobile platform, you can quickly connect, manage and monitor your devices from anywhere in the world.
Arduino IoT Cloud allows you to automatically create any code to program your device with - just add a couple of lines to customize it how you want.

### How to Connect
1. Register your Arduino IoT Cloud capable board via Arduino IoT Cloud (Devices Section).
2. Create a new logical representation known as a Thing.
